    <p class=plain_text>I painted these two primaris intercessors as a preview of what I need to do for my starter set of Warhammer 40k: Dark Imperium miniatures. I purchased a starter paint kit from a local
    hobby store, and it luckily (or by design) included three models identical to the ones that I would be painting en masse soon. There were only about three colors that made sense to
    use from the painting kit, but it seemed to work out pretty well. I am actually going to have to go with a different color scheme for my sub-faction in the game, with the most
    dominant colors being black, white, and dark green instead of black, blue, and gold. It has been fun getting started, and I needed to buy two or three books just to play with
    my desired sub-faction beyond the starter set, and I still need to get a specialized box to carry the miniatures, the "canon" color scheme paints, more models to fill out a small to mid-sized
    army roster, and lots and lots of dice - so I will not be starting right away. But in a month or so, watch out!</p>

    <p class=plain_text>Here is the first Primaris Intercessor Space Marine that I have painted up, using the Dark Imperium set paint selections and instructions for the Dark Angels chapter. It was my first time using the "Nuln Oil"
    shader, and it made the green seem a little darker, dirtier, and worn. I have only added highlights in one shade of green so far, and I might add more variety to the highlights later. Some detailing is still required for
    this soldier, like the chest aquila emblem that needs to be a creamy white, apparently. The gun is also supposed to be scarlet, but I might not stick to the standard paint patterns for the Dark Angels chapter - they bend
    the rules with some unique units, traits, etc. anyway! It might depend on how flexible my local game shop opponents are regarding the gun color - I can always paint them later if required. The final aspect of the paint job
    that I would like to draw your attention to is the holster for the pistol - the "brown" came out as more of a tan/yellow color than expected, so I might choose a different color for that or mix my own - it just seems a
    little too bright for this color scheme, but it does not clash or anything so I will have to look at it a few more times and then decide what to do! This took me a while to paint, but I think I am on the right track for my
    first Warhammer 40k army!</p>
