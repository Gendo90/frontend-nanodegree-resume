    <p class=plain_text>I painted these two primaris intercessors as a preview of what I need to do for my starter set of Warhammer 40k: Dark Imperium miniatures. I purchased a starter paint kit from a local
    hobby store, and it luckily (or by design) included three models identical to the ones that I would be painting en masse soon. There were only about three colors that made sense to
    use from the painting kit, but it seemed to work out pretty well. I am actually going to have to go with a different color scheme for my sub-faction in the game, with the most
    dominant colors being black, white, and dark green instead of black, blue, and gold. It has been fun getting started, and I needed to buy two or three books just to play with
    my desired sub-faction beyond the starter set, and I still need to get a specialized box to carry the miniatures, the "canon" color scheme paints, more models to fill out a small to mid-sized
    army roster, and lots and lots of dice - so I will not be starting right away. But in a month or so, watch out!</p>
