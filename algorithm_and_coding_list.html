              <p>This <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python--ud513">Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms</a>
                  course, presented by Google and Udacity, was not a
                  requirement for any certificates or coursework that I have
                  done so far, but <em>is</em> a requirement for successfully
                  passing the technical part of most CS-related job interviews.
                  I wish that I had known some of this sooner, because it is
                  interesting and useful for designing and improving certain
                  core components of software, like runtimes, search speeds,
                  etc.</p>
              <br />
              <p>This course was a good introduction to a lot of the major
                  data structures, algorithms, and time/space complexities
                  that someone would see in technical interviews, but there is
                  still a lot more to learn! The course walks the student
                  through basic search, sort, hash, tree, and graph algorithms,
                  and mentions NP-hard problems at the end.</p>

              <p><a href="https://www.topcoder.com/">TopCoder</a> is a
              competitive coding website which also offers
              freelance work from companies that may not have enough of a
              workload to hire a full-time developer or would simply prefer not
              to. </p>
              <br />
              <p>Fortunately, their arena applet contains problems from all
              past competitions, so it is a good place to see a lot of
              computer "puzzles" with different difficulties and complexities.
              They have two divisions (I and II), and about three problem
              point-levels (250-350, 400-600, 1000+) so you can always find
              something at your current problem-solving level to work on. The
              scoring for each problem takes time into account, and it has
              really helped me improve both my speed and accuracy for code
              quizzes, as well as my understanding of different computer
              problems and concepts.

              is a website that allows users to practice code
              problems very similar to those presented in technical interviews.
              The problems have three difficulties (easy, medium, and hard),
              and different point values that usually correspond to the
              complexity of the answer (more complicated problems give more
              points). Each user gets full points for solving these data
              structure and algorithm problems correctly, with partial points
              given for solutions that work for some but not all of the test
              cases. Users gain "badges" representing how many points they
              have in a given category of problems, and these can be for
              general "problem solving" skills or more specific language
              skills (e.g. SQL, Linux scripts, Python language, etc.). I have
              been approaching a lot of their problems almost as a game, and
              feel like the questions are good representations of real
              interview questions.

              now grants digital certificates upon passing assessment tests, as part of a
              recent update! I have passed all the certification exams on the website
              other than the React exam, because I am currently learning Angular as my
              first frontend JS framework - although I am planning on learning React
              in the near future. This particular certificate was granted for passing
              an intermediate problem solving test, which would be similar to the
              level of difficulty of most technical interview problems. Each test
              has a time limit of an hour and a half, and is usually a couple of
              coding questions that are assessed against a number of test cases,
              including a few corner cases. These certifications are all on my
              HackerRank profile (that can be viewed by clicking the link or
              HackerRank symbol in the above section, or by clicking
              <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/patrick_gendotti?hr_r=1">here</a>),
              but I thought that it would be nice to showcase one of them here
              along with the other algorithms certificates.

              offers different coding assessments to employers, making it quick and easy for them to perform technical
              screenings before talking to job seekers. I took this general assessment about 6 months ago, on Nov. 4, 2019,
              and I scored relatively well given my background and experience. I essentially completed the two implementation
              problems and missed a corner case on the third because I thought it would be better to get partial credit on
              the fourth and final problem, but it was not (see score calculation
              <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:IHY_ITXc92AJ:https://codesignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/general-coding-assessment-framework.pdf+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us">here</a>).
              If you work for a company and want a nicer-looking PDF report with the same information, submit your contact info <a href="https://codesignal.com/resource/general-coding-assessment-framework/">here</a>.
              My score in the different categories (speed, problem solving, and implementation) largely reflect my TopCoder training for implementation,
              to get a working solution as fast as possible that satisfies all test cases, so I might have run a few too many tests to check the code and
              that might have hurt my score. Additionally, I have not been following a coding style standard for my Python code up to this point, because
              I have been coding solo, but I am looking at improving my code quality using tools like <b>pylint</b>, with info available <a href="http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html">here</a>.
              Finally, I had not been working through algorithm interview problems as much as data structure interview problems, because I did not see the
              "Algorithms" tab on HackerRank until after this test, and practice with more of those kinds of problems would have greatly assisted me with
              the final problem in this assessment, as the previous score calculation link explains.

              <br />
              <p>
                  Overall, I am satisfied with this score, since it means that I can be considered a "good" coder. A score of 738 places me in about
                  the top third of programmers evaluated with this assessment, and that is significant progress on my part from the beginning of 2019, when I
                  had no idea what algorithms were! You can see how this coding score serves almost as a "credit report" of programming skill, so
                  and how CodeSignal even hired a FICO executive to help them fine-tune this new tool

                  improved since then, and I keep working on problems and projects to make myself more attractive to recruiters and companies every day.

              <p>The <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer">Divide and Conquer, Searching and Sorting, and Randomized Algorithms</a>
                  course covers the basics of divide and conquer algorithms
                  and runtime complexities, using Mergesort and Quicksort as
                  examples of divide and conquer algorithms, among others. The
                  runtime complexities were analyzed using both recursion trees and
                  the Master Method, with less intuitive runtimes for problems like
                  the upgraded Karatsuba multiplication and Strassen's matrix multiplication
                  method getting generated in a fairly straightforward manner from the
                  application of the Master Method. The assignments consisted of
                  conceptual quizzes to test and expand on the concepts covered
                  in the (extensive) lectures, as well as "coding" problems that
                  required specific answers, usually numerical values, that
                  could only reasonably be generated by code that correctly
                  implements an algorithm discussed in the lecture. The
                  lectures were world-class, since they are essentially the same
                  as the ones given at Stanford in their CS school, which departed
                  from the usual lectures in MOOCs that involve shorter, less
                  rigorous explanations and analysis of the topics. The course
                  also introduced some practical applications of algorithms, like
                  how a popular service like Netflix or Youtube could "count
                  inversions" to derive how numerically similar two lists (of
                  videos, preferences, requirements, etc.) are and suggest videos
                  that people with similar tastes also liked or at least watched.
                  I did like getting more experience with recursion through the
                  different divide-and-conquer problems, because those were
                  initially a struggle for me to understand and get working
                  correctly.

                  course offered by Stanford as a way to
                  learn more about algorithms and algorithm design. This
                  course is the second in the 4-course

                  specialization available
                  on Coursera, which is equivalent to a Stanford computer science
                  course offered to sophomores, juniors, and seniors within the
                  school, and is ample preparation for graduate study of algorithms.

              <p>The <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-graphs-data-structures">Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures</a>
                  course covers the basics of graphs, their applications, and
                  search and shortest path algorithms that can be used on them
                  to inform someone of their details. It also explained heaps
                  and binary trees, including the basics of red-black trees and
                  reasons balanced trees are useful, and touched on the basics
                  of hash maps and Bloom filters and what properties to look
                  for when designing hash functions for an application. The
                  assignments consisted of conceptual quizzes to test and
                  expand on the concepts covered in the (extensive) lectures,
                  as well as "coding" problems that required specific answers,
                  usually numerical values, that
                  could only reasonably be generated by code that correctly
                  implements an algorithm discussed in the lecture. The
                  lectures were world-class, since they are essentially the same
                  as the ones given at Stanford in their CS school, which departed
                  from the usual lectures in MOOCs that involve shorter, less
                  rigorous explanations and analysis of the topics. The course
                  also introduced some practical applications of algorithms, like
                  how a graph search could be used to illuminate the entire
                  web graph, showing the basic structure of the world wide web.
                  Hash maps are one of the most commonly used data structures
                  due to their speed and relative ease of implementation.
                  The professor mentioned the strongly connected components (SCC)
                  coding assignment was the most difficult in this course, but
                  it was nice to see it to get more experience coding and
                  implementing complex algorithms, and the Kosaraju algorithm itself is
                  useful for "zooming out" on graphs by looking at only distinct
                  SCCs, which could simplify a graph and help with understanding
                  a complicated graph's structure better.

                  course offered by the University of Pennsylvania as a way to
                  learn more about data structures available as part of the Java programming language. This

              <p>The <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/data-structures-and-software-design">Data Structures and Software Design</a>
                  course covers basic and advanced data structures and their
                  implementation and uses within the Java language. For example,
                  students learn about the higher-level interfaces like
                  Set and List and how they concretely work with specific classes
                  like HashSets and LinkedLists. The course builds on these basic
                  data structures to explain more advanced data structures
                  like trees, treesets, and graphs (which are comprised of
                  linkedlists and sets). Some basic algorithms using graphs and
                  trees are then provided, such as BFS and DFS graph traversals,
                  and validating Hamiltonian paths.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The course then turns to general software design principles that are
                  used in the industry to make code modular, functional, readable,
                  and minimal. This part of the course focuses on more abstract
                  software quality and design paradigms like functional independence,
                  consistency, changeability, maintainability, etc. Software is
                  considered "good" not only because it works as specified, but
                  also because it is easy to understand, maintain, and change. The
                  assignments for this part of the course include UML-based systems
                  design and implementation, as well as designing software from
                  specifications/requirements.
