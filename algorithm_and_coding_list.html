              <p>This <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python--ud513">Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms</a>
                  course, presented by Google and Udacity, was not a
                  requirement for any certificates or coursework that I have
                  done so far, but <em>is</em> a requirement for successfully
                  passing the technical part of most CS-related job interviews.
                  I wish that I had known some of this sooner, because it is
                  interesting and useful for designing and improving certain
                  core components of software, like runtimes, search speeds,
                  etc.</p>
              <br />
              <p>This course was a good introduction to a lot of the major
                  data structures, algorithms, and time/space complexities
                  that someone would see in technical interviews, but there is
                  still a lot more to learn! The course walks the student
                  through basic search, sort, hash, tree, and graph algorithms,
                  and mentions NP-hard problems at the end.</p>
               <br />
               <p>
                   My code base consisting of exercises from this course are
                   available in my GitHub repo

              <p><a href="https://www.topcoder.com/">TopCoder</a> is a
              competitive coding website which also offers
              freelance work from companies that may not have enough of a
              workload to hire a full-time developer or would simply prefer not
              to. </p>
              <br />
              <p>Fortunately, their arena applet contains problems from all
              past competitions, so it is a good place to see a lot of
              computer "puzzles" with different difficulties and complexities.
              They have two divisions (I and II), and about three problem
              point-levels (250-350, 400-600, 1000+) so you can always find
              something at your current problem-solving level to work on. The
              scoring for each problem takes time into account, and it has
              really helped me improve both my speed and accuracy for code
              quizzes, as well as my understanding of different computer
              problems and concepts.

              is a website that allows users to practice code
              problems very similar to those presented in technical interviews.
              The problems have three difficulties (easy, medium, and hard),
              and different point values that usually correspond to the
              complexity of the answer (more complicated problems give more
              points). Each user gets full points for solving these data
              structure and algorithm problems correctly, with partial points
              given for solutions that work for some but not all of the test
              cases. Users gain "badges" representing how many points they
              have in a given category of problems, and these can be for
              general "problem solving" skills or more specific language
              skills (e.g. SQL, Linux scripts, Python language, etc.). I have
              been approaching a lot of their problems almost as a game, and
              feel like the questions are good representations of real
              interview questions.

              education website that specializes in
              offering academic-style courses and certificates to the general
              public. Many universities and other academic institutions create
              coursework for this online format, and I feel like it is a nice,
              self-paced way to learn online.</p>
              <br />
              <p>I enrolled in the
                  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox">Algorithmic Toolbox</a>
                  course offered by UC
                  San Diego and the National Research University Higher School of Economics as a way to
                  learn more about algorithms and algorithm design. This
                  course is the first in the 6-course
                  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms">Data Structures and Algorithms</a>
                  specialization available
                  on Coursera, a "micro-masters" program according to UCSD's
                  website.

              <p>The <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox">Algorithmic Toolbox</a>
                  course covers the basics of algorithms
                  and runtime complexities, repeatedly demonstrating why more
                  efficient algorithms are useful. The assignments consisted of
                  code submissions that needed to perform accurately and
                  quickly to pass. The problem-solving methods taught to help
                  design effective algorithms included divide-and-conquer,
                  greedy algorithms, and dynamic programming, which was good
                  for me personally to see, because I had not learned much
                  about these problem-solving methods from the Udacity and
                  Google's <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python--ud513">Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms</a>,
                  which introduced other topics like trees and graphs instead.

                  otherwise it would be too easy for my certificate to become
                  yours, too!
