                  main features of the Angular MVC framework. I personally
                  added uppercase letters to the password generator's
                  capabilities, because only lowercase letters could be used
                  in passwords from the vanilla app from the course.</p>

                  compare their results with. I found that this sort of lecture
                  structure worked better for me, because I could try
                  programming parts of the app on my own and did not have to
                  follow along with Stephen's coding. It also provided a nice
                  way of checking your work if you got stuck on something,

              <p>
                  I have updated this application recently (as of 3/2020) to
                  include additional "modes" beyond the original single
                  sentence matcher, including the paragraph and "full test"
                  (multiple paragraphs) modes. I added sound effects to alert
                  the user that there is a mistake in the text they have input
                  whenever they input more text, and disabled copying text into
                  the input area so the user must use the keyboard to type all
                  the text. I changed the styling of the "correct" and
                  "incorrect" text to a friendlier shade of green and to
                  underline mistakes (which helps when there is an error with
                  a space character that cannot be colored red), respectively.
                  I also added some basic statistics for the user to view upon
                  the end of the "tests" - namely the total time taken to
                  complete the test, the words per minute (WPM) with the caveat
                  that is WPM in Latin, not English. As a result, I decided to
                  include the measurement of characters per second (CPS) which
                  is a more language-agnostic measure of typing speed. I am
                  planning on adding more changes soon, like a different mode
                  that allows the test to complete with text that is not a
                  perfect match, with the results including an accuracy
                  statistic, and some way to report a score (maybe an email,
                  or a screenshot pdf).

                  I had already made this application using vanilla JS, so I
                  worked through migrating it to the Angular framework and
                  hosting it as a web application in its own right, not just a
                  feature of my website. Using the previous projects as
                  examples, I was able to quickly get the app working again in

                  is taught by University of Pennsylvania's top-notch faculty. The course
                  has really helped give me a solid foundation with regular expressions in JS, as well as an easy introduction to the React
                  framework. I look forward to building upon my React foundation developed here with more apps in the near future, since
                  it is the most popular front-end web development framework at the time of writing.

                  The application is essentially a four-function calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations,
                  and was built to satisfy requirements outlined by the edX class for robustness and functionality. For example,
                  certain edge-case scenarios were covered, such as divide by zero, consecutive operations, and repeating the last
                  operation by subsequent clicks of the "equals" button.</p>

                  all that refined, since I was focused mainly on getting the app working before refactoring it. The straightforward solution works best
                  for the HackerRank tests, because there is not much explaining if different classes or variables can be added, and certain requirements
                  on ids and attributes must be met. For example, I initially had each row of buttons in their own div, but they needed to be merged into
                  a single div with an id "btns" for any of the tests to work - but the calculator logic worked and the calculator performed exactly
                  the same to a user. With these sorts of strict requirements in place to pass the tests, creativity and more refined solutions are really
                  hampered.

                  The application is essentially a four-function calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations, but it uses a base-2 (binary)
                  input and display format. The binary calculator specs only require positive operands, and there can be negative results to operations
                  but the "-" button does not function as a unary "negative" operator, only as a subtraction operator, so the second operand cannot be
                  negative.</p>

              <p>This project was completed as part of the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/java-developer-nanodegree--nd035">Java Web Developer Nanodegree</a>,
                  through the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a> online education provider. It was the first project (of four) in this particular
                  Nanodegree program, and demonstrates the basic features of the Java Spring Boot framework in a full-stack web app. The application was intended to
                  serve as a proof-of-concept (POC) app at a startup that intends to compete with online services like Dropbox - by providing file, note, and
                  credential storage for a given user. It uses Spring Security to validate users, Hibernate to "persist" data, Thymeleaf to template the frontend UI from the backend data
                  model, and Bootstrap to accelerate and standardize frontend development, and Selenium and JUnit for integration testing.
                  </p>
              <br  />
              <p>
                  The project is hosted on AWS as an EC2 server instance, and is deployed to the domain <a href="https://www.lovelyhoneypot.world/login">www.lovelyhoneypot.world</a> -
                  this website name is a reference to how storing all this data in one place provides a prime target for hackers and other malicious actors on the Internet, who
                  look for servers rich in user information ("honeypots") to exploit and gain access to passwords and user accounts - like those included in the "Credentials" storage feature of
                  this application. So use this application at your own risk - it was intended as a POC and an exhibition of my new Spring Boot skills, not as a secure service. Any
                  information you put on this app is also liable to be deleted at any time, since I may need to reboot the server and that will clear all stored data - again, this
                  is not a fully-functional, user-ready app.
              </p>
              <br  />
              <p>
                  The next steps for this app would be to add data persistence,
                  so that the users, notes, files, and credentials are not
                  deleted from memory whenever the app is restarted on the server,
                  and to make the app more scalable. However, both these steps
                  cost significantly more money - since they both involve adding
                  more server instances with a load balancer and adding an external
                  database to store the data. So as a POC app,
                  this works just fine, because it demonstrates the basic functionality
                  of the app, without necessarily having a massive user base or a
                  large-scale deployment. Don't expect much to change with this
                  app in the near future - I have other projects that can be
                  leveraged better to work on!

              <p>This project was completed as part of the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213">C++ Nanodegree</a>,
                  through the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a> online education provider. It is the first project (of five) in this particular
                  Nanodegree program, and involves a basic route planner application written in C++. The project uses CMake to build the application, 
                  because it consists of multiple files, and runs an A* search algorithm to find the shortest route between a start point and 
                  destination. This project gives a basic outline for the Waze or Google Maps directions feature, which uses a similar algorithm to find the 
                  shortest route to get somewhere.

              <p>
                  The next step for this app would be to add a frontend user interface, with this application hosted on a backend server to 
                  plan routes given the current map. After that, different maps would need to be added so that users can find local routes
                  that satisfy the "shortest-path" requirement.
