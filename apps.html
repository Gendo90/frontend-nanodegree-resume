                  to help me learn the basics of Angular. The lecturer and
                  author of the course, Stephen Grider, walks the student
                  through creating this application to showcase some of the
                  main features of the Angular MVC framework. I personally
                  added uppercase letters to the password generator's
                  capabilities, because only lowercase letters could be used
                  in passwords from the vanilla app from the course.</p>

                  to perform programming tasks critical to building this
                  application, and then reviews his method for the student to
                  compare their results with. I found that this sort of lecture
                  structure worked better for me, because I could try
                  programming parts of the app on my own and did not have to
                  follow along with Stephen's coding. It also provided a nice
                  way of checking your work if you got stuck on something,
                  which a lot of online courses have problems with. You can

              <p>
                  I have updated this application recently (as of 3/2020) to
                  include additional "modes" beyond the original single
                  sentence matcher, including the paragraph and "full test"
                  (multiple paragraphs) modes. I added sound effects to alert
                  the user that there is a mistake in the text they have input
                  whenever they input more text, and disabled copying text into
                  the input area so the user must use the keyboard to type all
                  the text. I changed the styling of the "correct" and
                  "incorrect" text to a friendlier shade of green and to
                  underline mistakes (which helps when there is an error with
                  a space character that cannot be colored red), respectively.
                  I also added some basic statistics for the user to view upon
                  the end of the "tests" - namely the total time taken to
                  complete the test, the words per minute (WPM) with the caveat
                  that is WPM in Latin, not English. As a result, I decided to
                  include the measurement of characters per second (CPS) which
                  is a more language-agnostic measure of typing speed. I am
                  planning on adding more changes soon, like a different mode
                  that allows the test to complete with text that is not a
                  perfect match, with the results including an accuracy
                  statistic, and some way to report a score (maybe an email,
                  or a screenshot pdf).

                  I had already made this application using vanilla JS, so I
                  worked through migrating it to the Angular framework and
                  hosting it as a web application in its own right, not just a
                  feature of my website. Using the previous projects as
                  examples, I was able to quickly get the app working again in
                  Angular and back up on my site!</p>

                  and to produce code that could be used in other apps, such
                  as a roulette wheel or board game style spin selector.
                  I used my logo as the spinner image, and future versions
                  of the app will likely include a range of images that
                  can be spun. I hope you enjoy this basic version of the
                  Fidget Spinner app - with the main advantages over a physical
                  fidget spinner being availability, portability, and cost, since
                  it is available on any device that has loaded the app webpage
