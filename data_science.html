              <p>This project was completed to solidify my understanding of
                  API calls in python to gather data, as part of the <a href="https://bootcamp.berkeley.edu/data/">UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp</a>.
                  There were two parts to this project - data collection using the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">Open Weather API</a> to get
                  current weather data for over 500 cities worldwide. The main purpose of this part of the project was to "prove" that the latitudes
                  closer to the equator are warmer by sampling data uniformly across latitudes and longitudes around the world. The data actually shows
                  that the tilt of the earth's axis for the Northern hemisphere's summer made temperatures peak at about 23 degrees latitude, as
                  demonstrated <a href="https://github.com/Gendo90/python-api-challenge/blob/master/output_data/Temp_vs_Latitude_All_Cities.png">here</a>. There
                  are strong linear fits across the southern and nothern hemispheres, with r-squared values of 0.84 and -0.72, with the fit likely
                  improving if the data for each line were split by the 23-degree latitude instead of the equator. The WeatherPy notebook detailing these
                  results more extensively is available <a href="https://gendo90.github.io/python-api-challenge/">here</a>.</p>

                      The second part of the project involved planning a vacation based on certain climate characteristics. These climate characteristics
                      only matched a few cities around the world at the time of the notebook's creation, and could be adjusted depending on your preferences.
                      The notebook finds hotels near the ideal climate coordinates using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/overview">Google Places API</a>.
                      This notebook also plots a <a href="images/thumbnails/vacation_heatmap.png">heatmap</a> showing the relative humidity levels
                      across the globe - but note that these levels are not standardized to moisture content in the air which changes for different temperatures.
                      The VacationPy notebook with the code for these results is available <a href="https://github.com/Gendo90/python-api-challenge/blob/master/starter_code/VacationPy.ipynb">here</a>.

              <p>This ETL project was planned and developed as
                  as part of the <a href="https://bootcamp.berkeley.edu/data/">UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp</a>. The purpose of this project is to enable storage of
                  1-minute cryptocurrency price data in a SQL database on a computer, to allow comparisons between cryptocurrencies or further analysis of historical price data.
                  This data is not readily available using APIs or Kaggle, since there is no large, centralized exchange of cryptocurrencies like there is for equities in the for of a
                  stock exchange, like the NYSE or NASDAQ. This was especially true in the earlier years of cryptocurrencies, and the data here only goes back to about 2014 for Bitcoin and
                  to about 2016 for Ethereum. The 2016 Ethereum date is close to the start of the modern Ethereum blockchain, so that is not as much an issue as Bitcoin, which dates back to
                  2009. Using the Coinbase Pro API, historical data for these cryptocurrencies was not available before around 2017, making this project worthwhile to use if planning long-term price
                  analysis of the two major cryptocurrencies. The initial data sets were downloaded from Kaggle (see the readme for sources), and then patched to a contemporary date when the
                  project was released using the Coinbase Pro <a href="https://docs.pro.coinbase.com/#get-historic-rates">"candles"</a> API to retrieve historical 1-minute price data for both Bitcoin and Ethereum.
                  The project uses a Jupyter Notebooks with Python and pandas to load the data into a SQL database containing two tables, one for Bitcoin and one for Ethereum, and uses a separate
                  notebook to "patch" the data by retrieving up-to-the-minute prices (which may be delayed by about 10 minutes depending on the API results), which are then appended to the SQL
                  tables for each cryptocurrency. These SQL tables could form the base for further price analysis or even enable intelligent trading algorithms that incorporate historical prices
                  into their trading strategies.

                  prototype internal "app" that could be used to determine if a current auto loan customer presents a default risk at TVS. TVS is a motorcycle company in India, and the real-world
                  data provided was used to train the models and includes vehicle loan, customer, and payment data. The data was sourced from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a>
                  and is available <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/sjleshrac/tvs-loan-default">here</a>. As a general overview, we found that a gradient-boosted tree ensemble could accurately predict about 30-40% of all
                  historical defaulters without eliminating too many valid loan customers given a theoretical cost function to estimate savings from preventing defaults. More information
                  about our project development process and results are available as a PDF <a href="https://github.com/Gendo90/TVS-default-risk/blob/main/ML%20Default%20Loan%20Project%20Presentation.pdf">here</a>.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                  The internal app prototype that could be used by a TVS loan officer to check if a customer should receive a personal loan offer given their demographics and vehicle loan payment history with TVS
                  is available <a href="https://rocky-badlands-21201.herokuapp.com/">here</a> - served by <a href="https://www.heroku.com/platform">Heroku</a>. The app may take up to 30 seconds to load due to server settings on Heroku, and information about default/non-default loan
                  inputs are available at the bottom of <a href="https://github.com/Gendo90/TVS-default-risk/blob/main/ML/model_notebooks/model_evaluation/Model%20Loading%20%26%20Scoring-Custom_Function.ipynb">one of the project's Jupyter notebooks</a> (output cells 14 and 15) in case you wanted to try out the app! Please note that the currency is rupees since this is an Indian company.

                  <br />
              <p>My code for this project is available
                  <a href="https://github.com/Gendo90/TVS-default-risk">here</a> on Github. Again, the <a href="https://github.com/Gendo90/TVS-default-risk/blob/main/ML%20Default%20Loan%20Project%20Presentation.pdf">project presentation</a> details the ML methods and development process for this app, as
                  well as the next steps to improve the project.</p>

                    This <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/blog/how-this-developer-upskilled-his-career-with-berkeley-data-analytics-boot-camp">interview</a> was given regarding my upskilling experience with 
                    the <a href="https://bootcamp.berkeley.edu/data/">UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp</a>. The purpose of this interview is to help aspiring
                    developers determine whether the bootcamp is right for them in their programming journey, as well as to showcase an example student's outcome and 
                    perspective - mine! 
                </p>
                    <br />
                <p>
                    I personally had a great experience with this bootcamp, but I would highly advise anyone starting to learn programming to 
                    work through some other basic, cheaper, online courses first before attempting this bootcamp. The bootcamp is a large time 
                    commitment, with about 12 hours of class a week and weekly homework projects for six months, is expensive compared to other online 
                    options for learning data science and programming, and is not exactly beginner-friendly (about 1/3 of the class dropped out, which is probably a typical result). 
                    For example, there are a lot of <b>free</b> <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a> <a href="https://www.udacity.com/courses/all?field=school-of-data-science&price=Free">data science</a> and <a href="https://www.udacity.com/courses/all?field=school-of-programming&price=Free">programming</a> 
                    classes that would be good to try before enrolling in this bootcamp, and understanding the basics of <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/what-is-programming--ud994">programming</a>, <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110">Python</a>, 
                    <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-javascript--ud803">Javascript</a>, <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud001">HTML/CSS</a>, and <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/sql-for-data-analysis--ud198">SQL</a> should be prerequisites but are not! So I would recommend this bootcamp for beginner to intermediate 
                    software developers who already know something about programming and programming languages and have already taken some introductory 
                    classes in computer/data science and enjoyed working through those classes!

              <p>
                  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> is a website geared towards teaching data science through
                  free online tutorials, shared notebooks and datasets, and competitions. I first heard about this resource through
                  the UC Berkeley Data Analytics bootcamp, and much of the coursework for that bootcamp was drawn from publicly-available datasets on
                  Kaggle. In addition to thousands of free, easily accessible datasets to analyze and create ML models for, there are also introductory classes
                  that cover basic to advanced data science and ML concepts like data cleaning, feature engineering, game AIs, and neural networks, as well as
                  basic programming skills in Python and pandas. You can check out these courses <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn">here</a>.
              </p>
                  <br />
              <p>
                  In addition to free, interactive, online courses, you can also upload your own datasets to the website to share with others
                  who might want to use your data. So far, I have shared two datasets - one for the cryptocurrency ETL project listed <a href="https://github.com/Gendo90/Crypto-Historical-Prices">above</a>,
                  and one for a comprehensive Magic: The Gathering (MTG) card catalog available <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickgendotti/mtg-all-cards">here</a>.
                  The MTG card catalog dataset has been more popular by far, so I would expect a lot of the Kaggle users to be younger/students who might not have as much
                  use for cryptocurrency pricing data because they might not be working and have funds to invest.
              </p>
                  <br />
              <p>
                  The website also hosts online data science and ML <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions">competitions</a>, which can be used as educational tools to learn new data science and ML techniques, or
                  as a way to make some money because some of the competitions have cash or other rewards for top-ranked submissions. The competition is usually stiff for
                  the cash competitions, and people with all levels of experience and backgrounds can compete, so I have not really participated in any non-educational
                  competitions at this time. The competitions can have difficult datasets from real companies, and are sometimes sponsored by those companies to get working solutions
                  to data science problems they are facing without having to hire full-time data scientists (as an "outsourcing" sort of solution). Sometimes these competitions can
                  result in internship/job offers, but they are probably more competitive than the regular hiring channels. Also, the point differences between the top-ranked teams can often
                  be slight, so there is also the issue of diminishing returns with some of the competitions if you are looking to win and make money vs. what a real-world solution would be.
              </p>

                  Finally, if you want to see some examples of the introductory online course certificates they give you when you complete one of their courses,
                  you can check out my <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/certification/patrickgendotti/intro-to-ai-ethics">Intro to AI Ethics certificate</a>,
                  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/certification/patrickgendotti/intro-to-deep-learning">Intro to Deep Learning certificate</a>, and
                  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/certification/patrickgendotti/intro-to-game-ai-and-reinforcement-learning">Intro to Game AI and Reinforcement Learning certificate</a>!
                  These certificates are not too hard to get since they only take ~4-8 hours of work each, but they sure are fun to look at!
