              <p>This project was completed to solidify my understanding of
                  API calls in python to gather data, as part of the <a href="https://bootcamp.berkeley.edu/data/">UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp</a>.
                  There were two parts to this project - data collection using the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">Open Weather API</a> to get
                  current weather data for over 500 cities worldwide. The main purpose of this part of the project was to "prove" that the latitudes
                  closer to the equator are warmer by sampling data uniformly across latitudes and longitudes around the world. The data actually shows
                  that the tilt of the earth's axis for the Northern hemisphere's summer made temperatures peak at about 23 degrees latitude, as
                  demonstrated <a href="https://github.com/Gendo90/python-api-challenge/blob/master/output_data/Temp_vs_Latitude_All_Cities.png">here</a>. There
                  are strong linear fits across the southern and nothern hemispheres, with r-squared values of 0.84 and -0.72, with the fit likely
                  improving if the data for each line were split by the 23-degree latitude instead of the equator. The WeatherPy notebook detailing these
                  results more extensively is available <a href="https://gendo90.github.io/python-api-challenge/">here</a>.</p>

                  <p>
                      The second part of the project involved planning a vacation based on certain climate characteristics. These climate characteristics
                      only matched a few cities around the world at the time of the notebook's creation, and could be adjusted depending on your preferences.
                      The notebook finds hotels near the ideal climate coordinates using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/overview">Google Places API</a>.
                      This notebook also plots a <a href="images/thumbnails/vacation_heatmap.png">heatmap</a> showing the relative humidity levels
                      across the globe - but note that these levels are not standardized to moisture content in the air which changes for different temperatures.
                      The VacationPy notebook with the code for these results is available <a href="https://github.com/Gendo90/python-api-challenge/blob/master/starter_code/VacationPy.ipynb">here</a>.

              <p>This ETL project was planned and developed as
                  as part of the <a href="https://bootcamp.berkeley.edu/data/">UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp</a>. The purpose of this project is to enable storage of
                  1-minute cryptocurrency price data in a SQL database on a computer, to allow comparisons between cryptocurrencies or further analysis of historical price data.
                  This data is not readily available using APIs or Kaggle, since there is no large, centralized exchange of cryptocurrencies like there is for equities in the for of a
                  stock exchange, like the NYSE or NASDAQ. This was especially true in the earlier years of cryptocurrencies, and the data here only goes back to about 2014 for Bitcoin and
                  to about 2016 for Ethereum. The 2016 Ethereum date is close to the start of the modern Ethereum blockchain, so that is not as much an issue as Bitcoin, which dates back to
                  2009. Using the Coinbase Pro API, historical data for these cryptocurrencies was not available before around 2017, making this project worthwhile to use if planning long-term price
                  analysis of the two major cryptocurrencies. The initial data sets were downloaded from Kaggle (see the readme for sources), and then patched to a contemporary date when the
                  project was released using the Coinbase Pro <a href="https://docs.pro.coinbase.com/#get-historic-rates">"candles"</a> API to retrieve historical 1-minute price data for both Bitcoin and Ethereum.
                  The project uses a Jupyter Notebooks with Python and pandas to load the data into a SQL database containing two tables, one for Bitcoin and one for Ethereum, and uses a separate
                  notebook to "patch" the data by retrieving up-to-the-minute prices (which may be delayed by about 10 minutes depending on the API results), which are then appended to the SQL
                  tables for each cryptocurrency. These SQL tables could form the base for further price analysis or even enable intelligent trading algorithms that incorporate historical prices
                  into their trading strategies.
