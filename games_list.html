                  to help me and others learn Python.
                  The game consists of three vocabulary quizzes of varying
                  difficulty - easy, medium, and hard. You have a list of words
                  you can use (a word bank) and attempt to fill in the blanks
                  of a paragraph with these words. This is a text-based game,
                  and you need to have Python installed on your computer to run
                  and play it successfully!</p>
              <br />
              <p>In order to play this game, you need to run
              <a target="_blank" download href="vocab_game/fill-in-the-blanks_version_2.py">this</a>
              file from a terminal window using the 'python
              fill-in-the-blanks_version_2.py' command. Again, you need to have
              Python on your computer for this game to work! If you save the file
              to a different name than 'fill-in-the-blanks_version_2.py' then
              you can also run the game using that file name instead of
              'fill-in-the-blanks_version_2.py' after the 'python' command!</p>

                  The JavaScript code manipulates "Enemy" and "Player" object
                  sprites on the HTML Canvas, with assets provided by
                  Udacity as part of their <a href="https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game">Arcade Game Project repo</a>.

              <p>You need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser to run this game. This game
              is completely browser-based, and you should be able to start playing it by
              opening the <a href="frogger_game/frogger-game.html">game here</a> in your browser. If you do not see the
              bugs moving across the screen when trying to play the game, make <b>sure</b> you
              have JavaScript enabled on your browser!</p>
              <br />
              <p>The goal of this game is for your player character (the child) to reach the
              water at the top of the screen without getting hit by any of the "enemy" bugs.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>Your character will move in response to the player pressing the arrow keys
              (←,↑,→,↓) in the direction of the pressed arrow key. For example, if the player
              presses the <b>left</b> arrow key (←), the player character will move <b>left</b>
              one space, unless the character is at the left edge of the screen, in which
              case the character will not move.</p>
              <br />
              <p>The player will be able to tell when they have successfully reached the water
              and won the game because a message pops up when the player character reaches
              the water, and then resets the game after the player presses a confirmation
              button.</p>
              <br />
              <p>If the player character collides with any of the enemies, then the game will
              automatically reset without the "win" screen showing!</p>
              <br />
              <p>My code for "Frogger" is available <a href="https://github.com/Gendo90/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game">here</a> on Github.</p>
