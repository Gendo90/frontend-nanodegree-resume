                  to help me and others learn Python.
                  The game consists of three vocabulary quizzes of varying
                  difficulty - easy, medium, and hard. You have a list of words
                  you can use (a word bank) and attempt to fill in the blanks
                  of a paragraph with these words. This is a text-based game,
                  and you need to have Python installed on your computer to run
                  and play it successfully!</p>
              <br />
              <p class="center-text">In order to play this game, you need to run
              <a target="_blank" download href="vocab_game/fill-in-the-blanks_version_2.py">this</a>
              file from a terminal window using the 'python
              fill-in-the-blanks_version_2.py' command. Again, you need to have
              Python on your computer for this game to work! If you save the file
              to a different name than 'fill-in-the-blanks_version_2.py' then
              you can also run the game using that file name instead of
              'fill-in-the-blanks_version_2.py' after the 'python' command!</p>
