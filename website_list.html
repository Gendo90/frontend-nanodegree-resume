                  to help me learn the basics of HTML and CSS. I made a website
                  focusing on the history of rock music from its
                  beginnings with Elvis Presley until it started
                  diverging from mainstream "pop" music, with the market for
                  music in America became more diverse and fragmented.</p>

               <p class="center-text">There were not a lot of innovative
                   features used for this website since it was mostly an
                   introduction to website structure and design, but feel free
                   to send me any comments through the website's textbox form,
                   which I will receive at my primary email address!

                  to help me learn about full-stack website solutions and get
                  experience developing my own full-stack web application. The
                  application itself stores book collections for individual
                  users, with all books in the collections available for anyone
                  to view and learn about, but not edit. Only the "owner" of
                  each book has permission to add, edit, or delete books from
                  their collection, but there can be duplicates of any book
                  in other users' collections that are still visible to the
                  public. Later versions of this software will address
                  scalability and monetization issues.

                  The website at www.bestbookcollection.com uses the
                  following frameworks and software tools to operate
                  effectively, and consists of a full-stack using the items
                  that follow. The Flask web development framework
                  and the SQLAlchemy ORM flexibly execute and manage the
                  website as it grows, and the web application itself is
                  hosted on a remote Ubuntu Linux server as a WSGI app with
                  the Apache HTTP server software. The SQLAlchemy ORM connects
                  to a PostgreSQL database on the Ubuntu server to store and
                  retrieve the data used to populate the website with books.
                  Finally, some online, third-party "cloud" resources were
                  used to make this website, including Amazon Lightsail and
                  CloudFront, Facebook Oauth 2.0 login, and Google Oauth 2.0
                  login and custom search API.
