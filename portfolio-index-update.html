                                Patrick Gendotti is a mechanical engineer with an M.S.
                                from the University of Southern California and
                                currently lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. He is
                                currently shifting his career focus from mechanical
                                engineering to software engineering, especially web
                                site design and deployment, using books and online
                                programs like Udacity. In fact, this homepage is
                                a portfolio project completed as part of a Udacity
                                course.

                                Patrick Gendotti is also learning skills outside
                                of his core competency of engineering/software
                                design. These ancillary skills include cooking,
                                sketches, and 3D modeling and printing/animation.
                                He has been trying recipes from a couple of cookbooks
                                (The Real Food Cookbook and The Skinnytaste Cookbook),
                                all of which have turned out great! Patrick Gendotti
                                is enrolled in multiple Udemy courses teaching
                                drawing and other art techniques, with his
                                sketches thus far being attributable to skills
                                taught in "The Ultimate Drawing Course: Beginner
                                to Advanced". Finally, not much work has been done
                                in the 3D models section of the site, because there
                                are no online courses or books currently being
                                consumed to develop skills in this area - everything
                                there is less structured and less formally taught/learned right now. Since 3D computer work is a relatively new field, expect more additions later as more opportunities for learning and more software become available!
