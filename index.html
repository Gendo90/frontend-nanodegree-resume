    <p>
      Patrick Gendotti is a mechanical engineer with an M.S. from the University of
      Southern California and currently lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. He is
      currently shifting his career focus from mechanical engineering to software
      engineering, especially web site design and deployment, using books and
      online programs like Udacity. In fact, the resume link on this website takes
      you to a webpage project completed as part of a Udacity course.

      Patrick Gendotti is also learning skills outside of his core competency of
      engineering/software design. These ancillary skills include cooking,
      sketches, and 3D modeling and printing/animation. He has been trying recipes
      from a couple of cookbooks (<em>The Real Food Cookbook</em> and
      <em>The Skinnytaste Cookbook</em>), all of which have turned out great!
      Patrick Gendotti is enrolled in multiple Udemy courses teaching drawing
      and other art techniques, with his sketches thus far being attributable to
      skills taught in <em>"The Ultimate Drawing Course: Beginner to Advanced"</em>.
      Finally, not much work has been done in the 3D models section of the site,
      because there are no online courses or books currently being consumed
      to develop skills in this area - everything there is less structured and
      less formally taught/learned right now. Since 3D computer work is a
      relatively new field, expect more additions later as more opportunities
      for learning and more software become available!
